## Get startet
If you want to work on the project, first, you have to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), don't forget to add Node.js on the PATH of your system. After that, you can install Cordova with this command : `npm install -g Cordova`.

You can see all the platform I add to the project on the platforms folder. If you want to run the application on a specific platform you can run this command : `cordova run <platform name>`.

Be carfull, if you want to run on the android platform, you have to install the android SDK, and have an AVD (Android Virtual Device) or a real device. For all details and specific commands, you can check the [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) official website.
